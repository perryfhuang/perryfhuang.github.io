# Portfolio Template


## Objectives


## Purpose

What do you want people to find when they google you?
What do you want someone's first impression of you to be?
Your portfolio is the portal to your professional online presence.
It consolidates the content you've created on multiple platforms and presents
it in digest form, making it easier for future employers to learn more about you.

## User Stories to Get Started

- As a non-technical HR manager, I want to quickly evaluate whether this candidate has the skills and experience to fill an open position at my company.
- As a mid-level engineer, I want to evaluate a junior developerâ€™s coding skills by reviewing their projects and reading their code.
- As a friend of the person who built this portfolio, I want to understand what they do as a developer and what they have created.

## Required Sections
